# Stack
The program is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.

***
## What does the project do
This is stack written with different levels of protection: error codes, [canary protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow_protection), hashes, etc.

***
## Why is the project useful
Stack is a fundamental thing in programming and many complicated systems are based on it. Therefore, its reliability is necessary for correct
work of vast majority of software, and writing your own version will help with understanding both benefits and flaws.

***
## How to work with
This program should be launched in cmd.

```
$ g++.exe main.cpp Protection.cpp Stack.cpp -o main.exe
$ main.exe  
```

Then just follow the instructions of the program.
